# HR Analytics – Predict Employee Attrition

## About This Project

Employee attrition is a common problem in many organizations. When employees leave frequently, it increases hiring costs and affects overall productivity.

In this project, I analyzed HR employee data to understand the main reasons why employees resign and built a machine learning model to predict which employees are likely to leave.

The goal of this project is to help HR teams make better decisions using data.

## What I Did

• Cleaned and prepared the HR dataset using Python  
• Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find attrition patterns  
• Built classification models to predict employee attrition  
• Compared Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models  
• Selected the best performing model  
• Used feature importance and SHAP analysis to explain predictions  
• Created an interactive Power BI dashboard

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP
- Power BI
- Google Colab

---

## Key Insights

- Employees who work overtime are more likely to leave.
- Employees in lower salary bands show higher attrition.
- Employees with fewer years at the company tend to resign more.
- Some job roles have higher exit rates compared to others.

---

## Model Performance

- Built Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models
- Decision Tree performed better and was selected as the final model
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC score

---

## Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes:

- Overall Attrition Rate
- Attrition by Department
- Attrition by Job Role
- Attrition by Salary Band
- Attrition by Age Group
- Attrition by Overtime

The dashboard helps visualize trends and identify high-risk employee groups.

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

- Reduce excessive overtime workload
- Improve salary structure for lower income employees
- Provide better career growth opportunities
- Strengthen employee engagement programs

---

## Conclusion

This project shows how data analytics and machine learning can help organizations understand employee behavior and reduce attrition.

By combining predictive modeling and dashboard visualization, HR teams can take proactive steps to improve employee retention.
